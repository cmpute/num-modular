# num-modular

A generic implementation of modular arithmetics in Rust. It provide basic operators and an type to represent integers in a modulo ring (using Montgomery form). It also support various integer type backends, including primitive integers and `num-bigint`.

<!-- TODO for v0.1: Full Montgomery support>
<!-- TODO for v0.2: support ibig-rs -->
<!-- TODO for v1: no_std, signed integers -->
